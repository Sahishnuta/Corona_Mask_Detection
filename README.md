## Problem Statement

### **Real-time Face Mask Detection System for Public Health Safety**

**Core Problem:** 
The project addresses the critical need to automatically detect whether individuals are properly wearing face masks in public spaces, which became essential during the COVID-19 pandemic for enforcing safety protocols and reducing virus transmission.

**Key Challenges Being Solved:**

1. **Automated Compliance Monitoring**: Replace manual monitoring of mask usage in crowded areas like malls, airports, offices, and public transport.

2. **Real-time Detection**: Provide instant classification of mask usage status without significant delays.

3. **Multiple Classification Categories**:
   - With Mask ✅
   - Without Mask ❌
   - Improperly Worn Mask ⚠️

4. **Accessibility**: Create an easy-to-use interface that can be deployed across various environments with minimal technical expertise.

**Technical Approach:**
- Uses **deep learning with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)** for image classification
- Implements **OpenCV** for real-time face detection from webcam/video streams
- Provides both **image-based** and **real-time video** detection capabilities
- Built with **TensorFlow/Keras** for model training and inference

**Target Applications:**
- Public health monitoring in crowded spaces
- Entry control systems for buildings and facilities
- Workplace safety compliance
- Public transportation safety enforcement
- Retail and hospitality industry safety protocols

**Success Metrics:**
- High accuracy in classifying mask usage status
- Real-time processing capabilities
- User-friendly interface for non-technical users
- Reliable performance across different lighting conditions and face angles

The solution aims to bridge the gap between public health requirements and technological enforcement, providing a scalable tool for organizations to maintain safety standards during pandemic situations.
